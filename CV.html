    <h3><strong><u>Career Objective</u></strong></h3>
        <p>As a Computer Software Engineering student, I hope to complete my program with an internship in place for on-the-job insight and training. We learn so much in class, I can only imagine the day-to-day learning that takes place in this field. After completing an internship, it is a goal of mine to start with that company as a front stack engineer while expanding my knowledge on the back end so I can eventually have experience in both. My end goal within this career is to be a full-stack software engineer tackling everyday problems with the space to create in spare time.</p>

<h3>Academic Projects</h3>
    <h5><strong>Hello CSS</strong></h5>
        <p>This was one of my first projects using CSS. This project showcased not only CSS basics but where CSS can take us in regards to creativity. During this project we were introduced to internal and external CSS thus making this project the solid foundation to my CSS, HTML journey.</p>
    <h5><strong>Floats and Positioning</strong></h5>
       <p>This project was a chance for us to get creative! We used floats and positioning to create our own products webpage. We also did a webpage for a restaurant of our choice. This project was quite the challenge in trying to manipulate the elements without using flexbox!</p>
    <h5><strong>Flexbox</strong></h5>
       <p>Using flexbox, the construction of this webpage was based on the ability
        of the elements to move in a way that represents the used technolgy. If a user was using their mobile phone the media will shrink down to fit that size. We implemented this structure for both a tablet and desktop as well.
       </p>
    <h5><strong>Omni Food Replica Webpage</strong></h5>
       <p>During the duration of this project I was able to see how a well contstructed weppage looked within. We used multiple divs to create 
        multiple sections within the page some containing transparent backgrounds and hover effects in order to make the page come to life!
